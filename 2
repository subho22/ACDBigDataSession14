Q)
Fetch date and temperature from temperature_data where zip code is greater than 300000 and less than 399999. 

1)select date,temp from temperature_data where zipcode >300000 and zipcode < 399999;

Q)Calculate maximum temperature corresponding to every year from temperature_data table. 

2)select SUBSTR(date,7,10) As Year,max(temp) from temperature_data group by SUBSTR(date,7,10);

Q)Calculate maximum temperature from temperature_data table corresponding to those years which have at least 2 entries in the table. 

3)SELECT SUBSTR(date,7,4) AS year, MAX(temp) FROM temperature_data GROUP BY SUBSTR(date,7,4) HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;

Q)Create a view on the top of last query, name it temperature_data_vw. 

4)create view temperature_data_w AS SELECT SUBSTR(date,7,4) AS year, MAX(temp) FROM temperature_data GROUP BY SUBSTR(date,7,4) HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;

Q)Export contents from temperature_data_vw to a file in local file system, such that each file is '|' delimited. 

5)hive -e "select * from temperature_data_w" > ~/OutputFile.txt;
